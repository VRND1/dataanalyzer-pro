# Regression R² Score Display Fix

## Issue
The regression analysis was showing "N/A" for R² Score and Adjusted R² in the UI, even though the regression functions were calculating these values correctly.

## Root Cause
The UI components were expecting:
- `result.metrics.r2Score` for R² Score
- `result.metrics.adjustedR2` for Adjusted R²

But the regression functions were only returning:
- `result.rSquared` for R² Score
- `result.metrics.rSquaredAdj` for Adjusted R²

## Solution
Updated all regression functions and the `RegressionMetrics` interface to include the expected field names:

### 1. Updated RegressionMetrics Interface
```typescript
export interface RegressionMetrics {
  mse: number;
  rmse: number;
  mae: number;
  rSquared: number;
  r2Score: number;        // Added for UI compatibility
  rSquaredAdj: number;
  adjustedR2: number;     // Added for UI compatibility
  aic: number;
  bic: number;
  durbinWatson: number;
}
```

### 2. Updated calculateRegressionMetrics Function
```typescript
return {
  mse,
  rmse,
  mae,
  rSquared,
  r2Score: rSquared,           // Added
  rSquaredAdj,
  adjustedR2: rSquaredAdj,     // Added
  aic,
  bic,
  durbinWatson: dw
};
```

### 3. Updated All Regression Functions
All regression functions now return metrics with both field names:

```typescript
metrics: {
  ...metrics,
  r2Score: rSquared,           // Add r2Score for UI compatibility
  adjustedR2: metrics.rSquaredAdj // Add adjustedR2 for UI compatibility
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/analysis/regression/types.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to interface
2. `src/utils/analysis/regression/utils.ts` - Updated calculateRegressionMetrics
3. `src/utils/analysis/regression/linear.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
4. `src/utils/analysis/regression/ridge.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
5. `src/utils/analysis/regression/lasso.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
6. `src/utils/analysis/regression/elastic-net.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
7. `src/utils/analysis/regression/polynomial.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
8. `src/utils/analysis/regression/logistic.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
9. `src/utils/analysis/regression/quantile.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
10. `src/utils/analysis/regression/log-log.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics
11. `src/utils/analysis/regression/time-series.ts` - Added r2Score and adjustedR2 to metrics

## Result
Now when you run regression analysis:
- R² Score will display as a percentage (e.g., "85.23%")
- Adjusted R² will display as a percentage (e.g., "83.45%")
- Both values will show appropriate color coding (green for strong fit, blue for moderate, yellow for weak)
- No more "N/A" values for these metrics

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. All regression types (linear, ridge, lasso, etc.) return proper R² values
2. The UI can access these values through the expected field names
3. The values are properly formatted and displayed with appropriate styling
4. Both R² Score and Adjusted R² are available for all regression models

## Special Cases
- **Logistic Regression**: Uses accuracy instead of R² since it's a classification model
- **Quantile Regression**: Uses the quantile-specific R² calculation
- **Time Series**: Uses the time-series specific R² calculation

This fix resolves the issue where users were seeing "N/A" for R² scores and ensures all regression models display their performance metrics correctly.
